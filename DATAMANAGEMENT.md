# Data management in Big Data environments

Databricks and Google Colab are both popular environments for working with big data, particularly in the context of data science and machine learning.

Databricks is a cloud-based platform that provides a unified analytics engine for processing and analyzing large datasets. It includes a number of tools and features for working with big data, such as Apache Spark for distributed data processing, Delta Lake for data storage and management, and MLflow for managing machine learning workflows.

Google Colab, on the other hand, is a cloud-based platform for running Jupyter notebooks that provides free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs. It allows users to write and run Python code and includes a number of pre-installed libraries for working with big data, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Both Databricks and Google Colab offer a number of benefits for working with big data, including:

- Scalability: Because they are cloud-based, these environments can easily scale to handle large datasets and computing workloads.
- Collaboration: Both platforms offer features for collaborating with other users, such as sharing notebooks and code.
- Access to resources: Databricks and Google Colab provide access to powerful computing resources, such as GPUs and TPUs, which can be used for accelerating machine learning and data processing tasks.

## Cloud computing or my laptop ?

There are several key differences between working with BigData in a cloud computing environment versus working with it on a local computer:

- Scalability: Cloud computing environments are designed to be highly scalable, which means they can easily handle large volumes of data and computing workloads. In contrast, a local computer may have limited resources and may struggle to handle very large datasets.
- Cost: Setting up a local environment for working with BigData can be expensive, as it may require purchasing high-end hardware and software licenses. In contrast, cloud computing platforms typically offer pay-as-you-go pricing, which can be more cost-effective for businesses that don't have the budget to invest in expensive hardware upfront.
- Flexibility: Cloud computing platforms offer more flexibility in terms of where and how data can be processed. For example, users can easily spin up new instances of virtual machines to process data in different geographic locations, or they can take advantage of cloud-based storage solutions to store and access data from anywhere.
- Security: Cloud computing platforms typically offer advanced security features to protect against data breaches and other types of cyber threats. However, businesses must still take precautions to ensure the security of their data when using cloud services.
- Skillset: Working with BigData in a cloud computing environment requires a different skillset than working with it on a local computer. Users must be familiar with cloud computing platforms, as well as the specific tools and services they offer for processing and analyzing data.

# BigData programming languages

There are several programming languages and features that are commonly used for BigData work, including:

- Java: Java is a popular programming language for BigData processing and analysis, due to its scalability and compatibility with the Hadoop ecosystem. Java-based tools such as Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark are widely used in BigData applications.
- Python: Python is another popular language for BigData work, thanks to its ease of use and wide range of data processing and analysis libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. Python is also compatible with Hadoop and Spark, making it a versatile choice for BigData applications.
- SQL: Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard language for managing and querying structured data in databases. Many BigData platforms, such as Apache Hive and Apache Phoenix, support SQL-based querying, making it a valuable skill for BigData analysts and engineers.
- Scala: Scala is a programming language that combines functional and object-oriented programming paradigms. It is particularly well-suited for BigData work, thanks to its compatibility with the Apache Spark platform and its support for distributed processing.
- R: R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is widely used in BigData applications for data analysis and visualization, thanks to its extensive range of statistical and graphical libraries.

In addition to these programming languages, there are several key features and tools that are important for BigData work, such as:
- distributed processing, 
- parallel computing, and 
- data visualization

# Platforms we will work with during the course

## Google Colaboratory

Commonly known as Google Colab, is a cloud-based data science and machine learning platform that allows users to write and run Python code in a Jupyter notebook environment. It provides free access to a virtual machine with pre-installed packages and libraries for data analysis and machine learning, eliminating the need for users to install these tools on their local machines.

Some key features of Google Colab include:

- Jupyter notebooks: Google Colab provides a Jupyter notebook environment, which allows users to write and execute Python code in a web-based interface.
- Free GPU and TPU access: Google Colab provides free access to GPUs and TPUs, which can greatly accelerate the training of machine learning models.

# R as BigData tool

R is a powerful programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. While R is often associated with traditional statistical analysis, it can also be used for big data processing and analytics.

There are several reasons why R can be a good choice for big data processing:
- Data manipulation and analysis: R has a rich set of libraries and packages for data manipulation and analysis. This makes it easy to perform complex data transformations, filtering, and aggregation operations on large datasets.
- Machine learning: R has a growing set of libraries and packages for machine learning, including algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and more. These packages can be used to build models on large datasets and perform predictive analytics.
- Visualization: R has powerful tools for data visualization, including ggplot2, lattice, and others. These tools can be used to create high-quality plots and visualizations of big data.
- Community support: R has a large and active community of users and developers who contribute to its development and provide support through forums, blogs, and other resources.

When it comes to big data platforms for R, there are several options available:
- Apache Spark: Apache Spark is a popular big data processing engine that can be used with R. The sparklyr package provides an interface for using Spark with R, making it easy to process large datasets in a distributed manner.
- Hadoop: R can be used with Hadoop, a popular open-source big data platform. The rhdfs and rhbase packages provide interfaces for using Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and Hadoop Database (HBase) with R.
- Amazon Web Services: Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides several big data platforms that can be used with R, including Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce), which provides a managed Hadoop cluster, and Amazon Redshift, a cloud-based data warehousing service.
- Microsoft Azure: Microsoft Azure provides several big data platforms that can be used with R, including HDInsight, a managed Hadoop cluster, and Azure Machine Learning, a cloud-based machine learning platform.

# Starting BigData with R: Data management

## An example with SparkR

A large dataset stored in a distributed file system such as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and we want to perform some data management tasks on it using SparkR. 

We first need to start a Spark session using SparkR and load the dataset into a Spark DataFrame. We can do this as follows:


```
# Load SparkR package
library(SparkR)

# Start a Spark session
sparkR.session()

# Load data into Spark DataFrame
df <- read.df("hdfs://path/to/dataset.csv", source = "csv", header = TRUE)
```

Once the data is loaded into the DataFrame, we can perform various data management tasks such as selecting columns, filtering rows, and aggregating data. Here are some examples:


```
# Select columns
selected_cols <- select(df, "col1", "col2")

# Filter rows based on a condition
filtered_rows <- filter(df, df$col1 > 10)

# Group data by a column and compute a summary statistic
grouped_data <- agg(df, "col1" = "sum", "col2" = "avg")

```

Finally, we can save the processed data back to a distributed file system:


```
# Save DataFrame to HDFS as Parquet file format
write.df(grouped_data, "hdfs://path/to/output.parquet", source = "parquet", mode = "overwrite")

```
